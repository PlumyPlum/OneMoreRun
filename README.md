# One More Run

Unreal Engine 5 C++ time-trial game focused on modular gameplay architecture and physics-driven mechanics.

---

## Overview

One More Run is a physics-based time trial project built entirely in Unreal Engine 5 using C++.

The project is intentionally structured to demonstrate:

- Clean gameplay framework usage
- Separation of concerns (Game / Player / Track / UI layers)
- Modular and scalable architecture
- Custom GameModes and GameStates
- Physics-based movement systems
- Checkpoint and timing logic

This repository represents an actively evolving systems-focused game prototype.

## Architecture

The project follows a layered structure:

Key architectural principles:

- Gameplay responsibilities are separated by domain
- Custom GameModes for different gameplay variants
- Persistent state handled via GameInstance
- Actor systems designed for scalability and reuse

---

## Technologies

- Unreal Engine 5
- C++
- Unreal Gameplay Framework
- Physics simulation
- Modular system design

---

## Current Status

Early production prototype.

Core time-trial loop implemented:
- Player physics movement
- Start/finish detection
- Checkpoint tracking
- HUD timing feedback

Next steps include:
- Gameplay polish
- Advanced movement mechanics
- Performance optimization
- Expanded track systems
